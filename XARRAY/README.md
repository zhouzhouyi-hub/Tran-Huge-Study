# Study on Linux XArray

The XArray is an abstract data type which behaves like a very large array of pointers. It meets many of the same needs as a hash or a conventional resizable array [1].

Radix tree was previously  used in page cache for searching page caches. However, after version 4.20 of the Linux kernel, it has been replaced by the XArray structure.
